<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/me.png" alt="">

I started this blog to focus more on the idea than on me, but if you must know, my name is Jess Cadena. I'm a senior computer science major at Texas A&M who likes to write English more than C++ at times. I'm not a prolific writer, and I have no editor, so please excuse any mistakes I make; this is a dork's blog, not the New York Times.
