Are you bothered by how much you rely on technology? Is your dopamine fried from the endless stream of entertainment tailored to your tastes? Have you ever washed your clothes without a washing machine? What started as a way to increase productivity has now infested every crevice it can find. It affects what we eat, who we know, where we live, and even what we think. Look at the internet alone. How many recipes do you have saved? How many crushes do you follow? Did you find your home online? How are you reading this?

You may get to pick your path, but you didn’t build the roads. And that’s not even starting on how your food is farmed, how the algorithm suggests your friends, how rent prices are estimated, or what random GitHub template lets me write here. Technology is something we’ve simply accepted as essential to existence, and while I’m no Ted Kaczynski, why do we adopt it so rashly? 

Technology has grown exponentially fast. We went from the Wright brothers to a man on the moon in just 66 years. You have more computing power in your pocket than world governments could afford 50 years ago. But have we grown exponentially in the same time? Are humans any better now than we were a century ago—spiritually or morally? Do we have the ability to command and use this technology, or are we only asking if we can, instead of if we should? Why are we so focused on what machines are learning? 

So for this blog, I pose the question I’ll try to explore in future articles: What should humans be learning?
